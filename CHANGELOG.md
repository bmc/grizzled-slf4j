title: Change log for Grizzled SLF4J
layout: default
---

Version 0.6.7:

* Converted to build with SBT 0.11.2.
* Added support for `ls.implicit.ly` metadata.
* Now publishes to `oss.sonatype.org` (and, thence, to the Maven central repo).
* Bumped [SLF4J][] version dependency to SLF4J 1.6.4.

Version 0.6.6:

* Pulled change from [Lucas Torri][] that changes logging method signatures
  to take `Any`, rather than `AnyRef`, allowing more parameter flexibility.
  Also handles `null` better.

Version 0.6.5:

* Now builds for [Scala][] 2.9.1, as well as 2.9.0-1, 2.9.0, 2.8.1, and 2.8.0.

[Scala]: http://www.scala-lang.org/

Version 0.6.4:

* Upgraded to version 1.6.2 of [SLF4J][].
* Converted code to confirm with standard Scala coding style.
* Backed out change made in version 0.6.1: Published Maven POM now lists
  `slf4j-api` as "compiled" again, instead of "provided". See comments
  in [Grizzled SLF4J Issue #3][].

[SLF4J]: http://slf4j.org/

Version 0.6.3:

Addressed [Issue #5][] via a patch provided by [Lucas Torri][]. Specifically,
the `Logger` object now supports this method:

    def apply[T](implicit m: Manifest[T]): Logger = apply(m.erasure)

Allowing this syntax:

    val logger = Logger[MyClass]

**Note**: As a result of this change, Grizzled SLF4J no longer supports
Scala 2.7.

Version 0.6.2:

* Per a suggestion from Josh Suereth, the `Logging` class's methods are
  now marked `@inline` and `final`, allowing the Scala compiler to pull them
  inline, if it can, for greater efficiency.

Version 0.6.1:

* Updated SBT build file so that published Maven POM lists the `slf4j-api`
  dependency as "provided". This change addresses
  [Grizzled SLF4J Issue #3][].

Version 0.6:

* Now builds against Scala 2.9.0-1, as well as Scala 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.8.0 and 2.7.7.
* Converted to build with [SBT][] 0.10.1

Version 0.5:

* Updated to build against [Scala][] 2.9.0, as well as the 2.7 and 2.8 series.

[Scala]: http://www.scala-lang.org/
[SLF4J]: http://www.slf4j.org/

Version 0.4:

* Updated to version 1.6.1 of the [SLF4J][] library.
* Added a `Logging` trait that can be mixed into a class, providing logging
  functions and a `Logger`, without changing the public API (similar to the
  [Logging][scalate-logging] trait in the [Scalate][] source). Addresses
  [Issue #1][issue-1].

Version 0.3.2:

* Now builds against [Scala][] 2.8.1, as well as 2.8.0 and 2.7.7.

* Now published to the [Scala Tools Maven repository][], which [SBT][]
  includes by default. Thus, if you're using SBT, it's longer necessary to
  specify a custom repository to find this artifact.
